    "The basic structure tracks how often each word appears and what word typically follows it. The idea is to create a transition map between words, where given one word, the chatbot can predict what word is likely to come next based on previous occurrences.\n",
    "\n",

    "The first extension improves the model by considering *bigrams* (pairs of consecutive words) instead of single words. This allows the chatbot to use a two-word context to predict the next word, making it more accurate because it can consider short phrases rather than just individual words.\n",

    "### Extension #2:\n",
    "The second extension introduces the concept of *characters*. For each character in a dataset (such as dialogue from a play or movie), it tracks their specific word patterns. This way, the chatbot can learn distinct speech patterns for different speakers, allowing it to mimic how each character would continue a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "- The original model looks at one-word transitions.\n",
    "- The first extension uses two-word transitions (bigrams).\n",
    "- The second extension separates the word patterns by character, creating a unique word transition map for each speaker."

    "Here's how the extension to the original Markovian ChatBot code works:\n",

    "### Original Markovian ChatBot Code\n",
    "The original code builds a simple Markov model where each word’s likelihood of being followed by another word is tracked. It uses a dictionary to keep track of word frequencies and another dictionary to track the frequency of the word that follows each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extension Explanation\n",
    "The extension adds complexity by incorporating character-specific Markov chains and using bigrams (two-word sequences) rather than just single words. Here’s what it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Character-Specific Markov Chains**: \n",
    "   - Instead of just using word frequencies, the code now differentiates between different characters in the text. This is achieved by creating a `characters` Counter that helps identify and label parts of the text according to which character is speaking.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Bigram Tracking**:\n",
    "   - Rather than just tracking the probability of a single word following another, the extension tracks the probability of a word following a bigram (a pair of consecutive words). This is done by:\n",
    "     - Creating `word_used2C` and `next_word2C`, which are nested dictionaries tracking bigrams and the next words following those bigrams.\n",
    "     - For each word in the text, the code updates the count for the bigram (a combination of two consecutive words) and then updates the count for the next word that follows that bigram, all while accounting for which character is speaking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "- **Character Detection**: The `character` variable helps to segment text according to which character is speaking.\n",
    "- **Bigram Frequency Tracking**: `word_used2C` tracks how often each bigram appears for each character.\n",
    "- **Next Word Prediction**: `next_word2C` tracks which words follow each bigram and how often, allowing the chatbot to generate text based on the context of the preceding two words rather than just one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, this extension builds on the original idea by adding layers of complexity to handle multiple characters and by using more sophisticated word sequences (bigrams) to improve the context and coherence of the generated text.\n",
