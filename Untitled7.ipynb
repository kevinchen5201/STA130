    "\n",
    "### Problem Introduction\n",
    "AliTech has developed a vaccine, and our goal is to determine if it has a statistically significant effect on patients’ health. Specifically, we’re comparing patients’ health scores before and after taking the vaccine. The key question is whether the vaccine has an impact on the \"Final Health Score\" compared to the \"Initial Health Score.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Null Hypothesis of \"No Effect\"\n",
    "In this context, the **null hypothesis** (often called \\( H_0 \\)) is that the vaccine has **no effect** on health. Statistically, this would mean that the average difference between the \"Initial Health Score\" and \"Final Health Score\" is zero. If we find enough evidence to reject this hypothesis, we would conclude that the vaccine has a significant effect on patients' health scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Visualization\n",
    "First, let's create a simple visualization comparing \"Initial Health Score\" and \"Final Health Score\" across all patients to see any observable changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Box Plot** of Initial vs. Final Health Scores\n",
    "2. **Histogram** or **Density Plot** of the difference between Final and Initial Health Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "These visualizations will help us quickly see if there’s a trend in the data suggesting improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantitative Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have a small sample, we’ll use **bootstrapping** to assess the effect of the vaccine. Bootstrapping will allow us to generate a distribution of average health score changes by resampling our data repeatedly. This can give us an idea of the range within which the true effect likely falls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "1. **Define the Difference**: For each patient, calculate the difference between \"Final Health Score\" and \"Initial Health Score.\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Bootstrap Sampling**: Using bootstrapping, generate a large number (e.g., 10,000) of samples from the observed differences to simulate the distribution of the mean difference. For each bootstrap sample:\n",
    "   - Randomly sample with replacement from the observed differences.\n",
    "   - Calculate the mean difference for each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Confidence Interval**: Compute a 95% confidence interval from the bootstrap samples. If zero is outside this interval, we can reject the null hypothesis. If it overlaps zero, we fail to reject it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Code Implementation**:\n",
    "   - Read data from a CSV.\n",
    "   - Implement the bootstrap procedure with a fixed seed using `np.random.seed()` for reproducibility.\n",
    "   - Calculate the 95% confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supporting Visualizations\n",
    "Plot the distribution of the bootstrap sample means for the difference in health scores. This can help visually assess if zero lies within the range of plausible values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Findings and Discussion\n",
    "- **Effectiveness of the Vaccine**: Discuss the results of the bootstrapped confidence interval. If zero is within the interval, we’d conclude that there’s not enough evidence to say the vaccine is effective. If zero is outside the interval, the vaccine is likely effective.\n",
    "- **Practical Significance**: Besides statistical significance, we could also discuss whether the observed difference is practically meaningful (e.g., is the improvement in health scores large enough to be considered beneficial?).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion Regarding the Null Hypothesis\n",
    "Summarize whether we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis based on the confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Considerations\n",
    "- **Sample Size**: With more data, we’d gain a clearer picture of the vaccine's effect.\n",
    "- **Control Group**: For a more robust study, a control group that doesn’t receive the vaccine would help us understand how much of the health score change is due to natural variation versus the vaccine.\n",
    "\n",
